/*
 * On certain motherboards(mainly Asus X299 boards), not all ports are
 * mapped in the RTC device. For the majority of the time, users will not notice 
 * this issue though in extreme circumstances macOS may halt in early booting.
 * Most prominently seen around the PCI Configuration stage with macOS 11 Big Sur.
 * 
 * To resolve this, we'll want to create a new RTC device(PNP0B00) with the correct
 * range.
 * 
 * Note that due to AWAC systems having an _STA method already defined, attempting
 * to set another _STA method in your RTC device will conflict. To resolve this,
 * SSDT-AWAC should be removed and instead opt for this SSDT instead.
